                    Reaching inaccessible locations for news coverage, especially in cases of natural
                    disasters and accidents, in a timely and cost-efficient manner is crucial for good
                    reporting for news agencies. Currently, one of the most common ways to collect video
                    evidence for such events is through the usage of helicopters. However, this comes at a
                    great cost, which is many times unbearable, especially for smaller news agencies.
                    DRONEWS aims to address this market gap by developing an end-to-end crowdsourcing
                    platform enabling News Agencies to source in a cost-effective manner, near-real-time, user
                    generated drone video streams to enrich news coverage and journalistic content towards
                    increasing their monetization potential. The aim of the DRONEWS project is to provide news
                    agencies and digital media companies with the ability to source near real-time user
                    generated drone videos of remote locations and/or urgent events such as accidents,
                    disasters etc. The key innovation of DRONEWS is that it enables the crowdsourcing of
                    drone-captured videos in real-time, the verification of the uploaded videos, video
                    intelligence for key frame extraction and annotation of captured scenes, and the automatic
                    removal of sensitive information from these videos.

                        DRONEWS addresses the modern digital and creative sector and particularly focuses on the
                        Media vertical industry in which Drone technology brings significant disruption and opens
                        up unprecedented opportunities to address the increasing needs for video content as a
                        primary means of communication with all types of audiences.
                        The opportunity to leverage the high and ever-increasing penetration of drones for
                        crowdsourcing videos from areas of interest in order to enrich digital news and articles
                        has so far not been possible due to the lack of an appropriate drone video crowdsourcing
                        platform. DRONEWS addresses this gap by supporting the needs of news agencies and
                        providing incentives to non-professional drone owners to use their drones to collect
                        videos from a nearby area where for example a disaster or other news-worthy incidence is
                        taking place or simply for offering to the audience fresh current videos of the areas
                        mentioned in the article (depending on viewing day/time). Our ambition is for DRONEWS to
                        become a go-to option for aerial footage collection for news and digital content
                        generation agencies and enable a sharing economy paradigm directly benefiting drone owners
                        as well.

                From a social perspective, DRONEWS enables good journalism practices by providing footage
                that is compliant with ethics and privacy protection standards. The privacy by design
                principle on which DRONEWS is based provides a solution to both big and smaller news
                agencies for provisioning privacy compliant video content. Furthermore, the reduced costs
                and time and the lower technical barriers for drone footage collection enabled by DRONEWS
                especially for disaster incidences allows faster incidence coverage with huge potential
                (possibly life-saving) benefits for locating and helping those impacted the most (women,
                children, the elderly).
                From an environmental point of view, DRONEWS can contribute in reducing GHG emissions
                for collecting both aerial and land footage. The pollutants produced when dispatching
                helicopters with camera crews come from the combustion of aviation fuel. A typical 1 hour
                trip with a conventional helicopter for aerial video recordings is emitting around
                150-300Kg of CO2. We estimate that DRONEWS can save up to 1Mn tones of CO2 emissions per
                year if used to substitute the transportation of camera equipment and aerial footage
                operations. Furthermore, helicopters are producing high levels of noise with 100 dB at 30
                meters above the ground which is 8 times as loud as vacuum cleaner. Such noise can disrupt
                animal habitats and create significant health damage after a prolonged exposure.
